## docker-s3-backed-ftp-server

Docker image for an S3-backed FTP server powered by vsftpd and s3fs-fuse.

## Usage

### Build

    on push to [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/buildo/docker-s3-backed-ftp-server)

### Run

```
$ docker run -itd \
  --cap-add MKNOD \
  --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
  --device /dev/fuse \
  -p 21:21 \
  -p 15393-15592:15393-15592 \
  -e S3_BUCKET=starbug-tandoori \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...I4Q \
  -e 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=X3p...lK1' \
  -e FTP_USER=vftp \
  -e FTP_PASSWORD=vftp \
  -e AWS_S3_URL='https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com' \
    flaccid/s3-backed-ftp-server
```

Use `openssl -1` to generate hashed plain password for `FTP_PASSWORD`.

### Tag and Push

    $ docker tag s3-backed-ftp-server flaccid/s3-backed-ftp-server
    $ docker push flaccid/s3-backed-ftp-server

### Known Issues

On Debian/Ubuntu hosts, `fuse: mount failed: Permission denied` is observed when trying to mount the s3 bucket. It is unclear which docker capability is missing for this distribution (using `--privileged` is the workaround).
